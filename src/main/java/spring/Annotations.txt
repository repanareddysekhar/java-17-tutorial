What are annotations?
Annotations in Java are a form of metadata, providing information about the code to the compiler, runtime, or other tools.
They are represented by the @ symbol followed by the annotation name. Some built-in annotations in Java include @Override, @Deprecated, and @SuppressWarnings.
